Giving color to the snake’s tail.
After the fruit is eaten, the score will be counted.
Checking for the snake’s head collisions with the body or the wall of the window screen.
Restarting the game automatically from the start after the collision.
The new shape and color of the fruit will be introduced every time the window is restarted.
The score will be returned to zero and a high score will be retained until the window is not closed.<br>
